# Tozny End-to-End Encrypted Database

The Tozny End-to-End Encrypted Database (E3DB) is a storage platform
with powerful sharing and consent management features.
[Read more on our blog.](https://tozny.com/blog/announcing-project-e3db-the-end-to-end-encrypted-database/)

E3DB provides a familiar JSON-based NoSQL-style API for reading, writing,
and querying data stored securely in the cloud.

## Quick Start

Please try out E3DB and give us feedback! Here are the basic steps.
E3DB has been tested on MacOS, Windows, and Linux:

 1. Download the appropriate binary from our
    [releases page](https://github.com/tozny/e3db-cli/releases) and save it
    somewhere in your PATH. For convenience, rename the binary to `e3db`.
 1. Register an account with [Tozny](https://dashboard.tozny.com/login) and save the
    JSON configuration info to the user’s home directory as ".tozny/e3db.json"
 1. Run `$ e3db ls` - You should see nothing at this point.
 1. Write a record: `$ recordID=$(e3db write address_book '{"name": "John Doe", "phone": "503-555-1212"}')`.
 1. `$ e3db ls` - You should see your new record.
 1. Read a record: `$ e3db read $recordID`.

## Terms of Service

Your use of E3DB must abide by our [Terms of Service](https://tozny.com/tozny-terms-of-service/), as detailed in
the terms of service agreement.

# Installation & Use

To obtain the E3DB CLI binary, download the latest release for your platform
from our [releases page](https://github.com/tozny/e3db-cli/releases).

After downloading the file, rename it to `e3db` for convenience and
set it as executable.

You should now be able to run the E3DB CLI via the `e3db` command:

```
$ e3db --help
Usage: e3db-cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [arg...]

E3DB Command Line Interface
[...]
```

## Registration

Register an account with [Tozny](https://dashboard.tozny.com/login) to get started. From
the Admin Console you can create clients directly. Save the client's JSON
configuration info to the user’s home directory as ".tozny/e3db.json" so the
Command-Line tool is configured to your client's credentials.

## Using the CLI

These examples demonstrate how to use the E3DB Command Line
Interface. Note that all E3DB commands have help, so anytime you can see
the documentation for a given command using the `--help` argument. For
example, you can see help on all commands:

```
$ e3db --help
...
```

Or help on a particular command, such as `read`:

```
$ e3db read --help
...
```

### Writing Records

To write a record containing free-form JSON data, use the
`e3db write` subcommand. Each record is tagged with a "content
type", which is a string that you choose used to identify the
structure of your data.

In this example, we write an address book entry into E3DB:

```
$ e3db write address_book '{"name": "John Doe", "phone": "503-555-1212"}'
874b41ff-ac84-4961-a91d-9e0c114d0e92
```

Once E3DB has written the record, it outputs the UUID of the newly
created data. This can be used later to retrieve the specific record.

NOTE: The CLI only accepts JSON documents with **string** values. Documents
with numeric, boolean, or object values will **not** be accepted.

### Searching & Listing Records

To list all records that we have access to in E3DB, use the
`e3db ls` command:

```
$ e3db ls
768d2ef7-36b4-4061-923c-d38bf72d03d3     message
50176d7a-c026-49bd-be1e-4df1e7c49b1f     message
```

#### Formats & Data

To see data associated with each record when using `ls`, use the `-jd` flags:

```
$ e3db ls -jd
[
  {
    "meta": {
      "record_id": "768d2ef7-36b4-4061-923c-d38bf72d03d3",
      "writer_id": "dac7899f-c474-4386-9ab8-f638dcc50dec",
      "user_id": "dac7899f-c474-4386-9ab8-f638dcc50dec",
      "type": "message",
      "plain": null,
      "created": "2017-05-03T16:38:00.692946Z",
      "last_modified": "2017-05-03T16:38:00.692946Z"
    },
    "data": {
      "content": "Twas brillig, and the slithy toves"
    }
  },
  {
    "meta": {
      "record_id": "50176d7a-c026-49bd-be1e-4df1e7c49b1f",
      "writer_id": "dac7899f-c474-4386-9ab8-f638dcc50dec",
      "user_id": "dac7899f-c474-4386-9ab8-f638dcc50dec",
      "type": "message",
      "plain": null,
      "created": "2017-05-03T16:38:00.692946Z",
      "last_modified": "2017-05-03T16:38:00.692946Z"
    },
    "data": {
      "content": "Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:"
    }
  }
]
```

#### Filters

Several filters are available for matching records. Each argument can take a comma-separated list of values:

- `-t`/`--type` - Retrieve records with the given content type.
- `-r`/`--record` - Retrieve records with the given ID.
- `-w`/`--writer` - Retrieve records written by the given writer. Each writer is identified by their unique ID or email address.
- `-u`/`--user` - Retrieve records written about the given user. Each user is identified by their unique ID.

#### Search & List Examples

Search for records (written by you) with a specific content type:

```
$ e3db ls -jd --type message
....
```

Search for records written by a set of writer IDs:

```
$ e3db ls -jd --writer dac7899f-c474-4386-9ab8-f638dcc50dec --writer 874b41ff-ac84-4961-a91d-9e0c114d0e92
...
```

### Reading Records

Individual records can be retrieved with the `read` command:

```
$ e3db read 768d2ef7-36b4-4061-923c-d38bf72d03d3
{
  "meta": {
    "record_id": "768d2ef7-36b4-4061-923c-d38bf72d03d3",
    "writer_id": "dac7899f-c474-4386-9ab8-f638dcc50dec",
    "user_id": "dac7899f-c474-4386-9ab8-f638dcc50dec",
    "type": "message",
    "plain": null,
    "created": "2017-05-03T16:38:00.692946Z",
    "last_modified": "2017-05-03T16:38:00.692946Z"
  },
  "data": {
    "content": "Twas brillig, and the slithy toves"
  }
}
```

### Sharing Records

E3DB allows you to share your data with another E3DB client. In order
to set up sharing, you must know the unique ID of the client you wish to share
with. Similarly, if others wish to share with you, they must know your unique
ID. To find the unique ID of your own client, run `e3db info`.

The E3DB client allows you to share records based on their content
type. For example, to share all address book entries with another
client (who has informed you that their ID is
`874b41ff-ac84-4961-a91d-9e0c114d0e92`):

```
$ e3db share address_book 874b41ff-ac84-4961-a91d-9e0c114d0e92
```

This command will set up an access control policy to allow the
client associated with the ID `874b41ff-ac84-4961-a91d-9e0c114d0e92`
to read your records with type `address_book`. It will also
securely share the encryption key for those records with the
client so they can decrypt the contents of each field.

## SDKs

Tozny provides SDKs for interacting with E3DB. We currently offer SDKs for the following languages:

- [Ruby](http://github.com/tozny/e3db-ruby)
- [Go](http://github.com/tozny/e3db-go)
- [Java](http://github.com/tozny/e3db-java)
- [PHP](http://github.com/tozny/e3db-php)

Each repository contains information about how to use the SDK,
where to find hosted documentation, and more.
